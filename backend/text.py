text = 'A Whisper in the Wind\nThe forest was still, save for the gentle rustling of leaves under moonlight.\nElara tightened her cloak and stepped forward, her lantern casting trembling shadows on the moss\ncovered stones.\nEach footstep was a memory, echoing through the trees that had once heard her laughter.\nTonight, the forest listened again - to secrets, to sorrow, and to the whisper of home.\n'
